## What exactly the Data is?
Its a large dataset with 10000 records of a list of customers of a Bank. Bank is recently facing a problem that a lot of its customers are leaving the Bank. The dataset contains details like CustomerID, CreditScore, Geography, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumberOfProducts, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary and if the customer has excited the bank or not. We are trying to analyze what type of customers are most likely to leave the Bank.

Here we have drew meaningful Insights and created multiple visualizations using Tableau for Churn Investigation. We also have Visualized ad-hoc A-B test, created Bins, classification tests for analyzing variables, combined multiple charts together, and validated mined data using Chi-Squared test.


## How can one obtain the Data?

## Individual Analysis and its Inference
## Here we have tried to analyze the total number of customers in different countries of Europe

## Here we have tried to visualize ad-hoc A-B test. We can see the percentage of each gender of customers who exited the Bank.

## Here we can see the actual values of each gender who exited.

## Here we have tried to analyze if having a credit card has a contribution in customers exiting the Bank. And actually it doesn't matters if you have a credit card or don't.

## Here we have tried to analyze does it affects to customers leaving the Bank if they are active or no. And we can see that customers who are less active have a tendency to leave the Bank.
